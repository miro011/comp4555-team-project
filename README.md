# Included mods:

- Background & Background Music (by Daniel Baranowski): 
    Adds a remix of a soundtrack from the Pac-man Theme and a nice-looking logo of the 3 Daniels (3D). The music will play in an infinite loop and can be muted using an "m" button (thanks to Daniel Yankov and his personal preference).
    Song credit: Arsenic1987 "Pac-Man Theme (Remix) 
    
- Color Theme Mod (by Daniel Faratro):
    Enables the user to switch between 4 preset color themes using keys 1 through 4 on the keyboard. This allows to user to select a preferred color scheme that may better suit their visual tastes and offer a more appealing visual experience with this rather simple game.
