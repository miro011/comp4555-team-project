# Included mods:

- Color Theme Mod (by Daniel Faratro):
    Enables the user to switch between 4 preset color themes using keys 1 through 4 on the keyboard. This allows to user to select a preferred color scheme that may better suit their visual tastes and offer a more appealing visual experience with this rather simple game.
    
- Alternative physics:
    - Ball will bounce to the same side if it hits the edge of the paddle.
    - Ball will keep the same direction if the ball and the board are going to the same direction.
    - More randomness (y axis change) when bouncing.
