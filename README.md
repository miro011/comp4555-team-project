# Included mods:

- Color Theme Mod (by Daniel Faratro):
    Enables the user to switch between 4 preset color themes using keys 1 through 4 on the keyboard. This allows to user to select a preferred color scheme that may better suit their visual tastes and offer a more appealing visual experience with this rather simple game.
    
- Alternative physics:
    - Added different bounce physics when the ball hits the top/bottom of the paddle.
    - Added randomness to the bounce angle/speed of the ball.
    - This Mod adds increased variability and improves the expected behaviour of how the ball should bounce when hitting the paddle at an extreme angle.
    
- Powerup mod: 
    - 3 powerup submods that works for both the human and AI opponent depending on who hit the ball last. 
    - Powerups activate for a short time when the ball touches the powerup, Multiple powerups may be active at the same time.
    - dynamically displays text for the powerups are currently active in the top-left or top-right of the screen.
    - Every few seconds powerups spawn/reset at a random height at the center of the screen.
    - Each powerup has a unique colour to help identify it.
    - These mods provide a fun side objective to aim for and helps makes it temporarily easier/harder to score for added variability.
- Powerup Submods:
	- Ball size increase (Yellow) - Temporarily increases the size of the ball to make it easier to physically block the ball and easier to collect more powerups.
	- Paddle Size increase (Purple) - Temporarily increases the size of the paddle to make it easier to physically block the ball.
	- Paddle speed increase (Cyan) - Temporarily increases the paddle speed to make it easier to reach the ball from far away.
